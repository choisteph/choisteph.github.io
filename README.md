# Hello, if you're reading this, that must mean you were curious about my portfolio site.

I developed a simple static portfolio website using Vite + React + Typescript to practice my React and Typescript skills as well as to learn how to build and deploy a React-based application.

_The development of my portfolio remains iterative and constantly changing! Check back in a couple months and it might look different._

## Design Rationale

### On Updating the Color Scheme and Mood

If you have seen my [previous portfolio](https://github.com/choisteph/old_portfolio), you can hopefully see that this new and updated portfolio follows a very different mood and color schema. I previously used darker colors and primarily a limegreen-centered color palette because I felt this was very "tech-y" and looked a lot like common text-editor colors. I decided to switch it up with my new design, using brighter colors to convey a more approachable and positive mood.

### On Updating the Home Page

I wanted to use interesting typography, colors, and "motion" to make my home page immediately interesting. I chose to put a small set of interesting skills (engineering and technical writing) that set me apart as a designer. For my projects, I used tags to describe proficiencies, tools, and industry to help immediately contextualize projects.

#### The Project List

I kept my project list short (3 projects total) so each project would be "important" enough to click through on. I chose projects where I was the most heavily involved with either design or development work so each slide deck would have substantial amounts of content.

### On Adding an About Me Section

I also added a fresh little "about" section with my design philosophy, some certifications I earned, and a list of competencies and tools I use as a professional. I wanted to offer a bit more context about the way I think, the things I'm working on, and the different things I've learned in my 5+ years trying to navigate this space.

### To Summarize,

**My goal with this redesign was to:**

1. Practice React, Typescript, and general development skills
2. Update how I represent myself online
3. Try new things and learn!

## Next Steps

The next functionalities and features I want to implement are:

1. **Web Accessibility: ARIA labels, adjusted contrast, dark mode**
2. A light mode to dark mode toggle (will this even be possible with a static site?)
3. Content reassessments: add additional content, remove existing content
