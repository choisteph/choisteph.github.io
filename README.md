# Hello, if you're reading this, that must mean you were curious about my portfolio site.
I developed a simple static portfolio website using Vite + React + Typescript to practice my React and Typescript skills as well as to learn how to build and deploy a React-based application.

*The development of my portfolio remains iterative and constantly changing! Check back in a couple months and it might look different.*

## Design Rationale
### On Updating the Color Scheme and Mood
If you have seen my [previous portfolio](https://github.com/choisteph/old_portfolio), you can hopefully see that this new and updated portfolio follows a very different mood and color schema. I previously used darker colors and primarily a limegreen-centered color palette because I felt this was very "tech-y" and looked a lot like common text-editor colors. I decided to switch it up with my new design, using brighter colors to convey a more approachable and positive mood.

### On Streamlining my Home Page and Adding (Rotating) Featured Projects
I also highly simplified the home page, choosing instead to feature a brief by-line and two randomly picked featured projects (thank you React `useState` and `useEffect` hooks!). I figured that the previous iteration of my porfolio was cluttered and cumbersome and this revamp would streamline visitors' access to relevant projects and information about myself.

### On Simplifying and Changing My List of Projects
In this revamp, I also simplified how I represent my projects: previously, I included a busy image of the project on a laptop screen. I chose instead to rely on emojis to offer a fun and approachable visual "summary" of the project. Overall I think the redesign makes it easier to see at a glance the kind of work I've done.

I also chose to highlight slightly different projects compared to the ones from my previous portfolio. My goal was to try to represent a range of different kinds of work I've done, as my path has been very non-linear.

### On Adding an About Me Section
I also added a fresh little "about" section with my design philosophy, soome certifications I earned, and a list of competencies and tools I use as a professional. I wanted to offer a bit more context about the way I think, the things I'm working on, and the different things I've learned in my 5+ years trying to navigate this space.

### To Summarize,
**My goal with this redesign was to:**
1. Practice React, Typescript, and general development skills
2. Update how I represent myself online
3. Try new things and learn!

## Next Steps
The next functionalities and features I want to implement are:
1. **Web Accessibility: ARIA labels, adjusted contrast, dark mode**
2. A light mode to dark mode toggle (will this even be possible with a static site?)
3. Content reassessments: add additional content, remove existing content
